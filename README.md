Mental Health Assessment Results Page
This HTML page dynamically generates a personalized mental health report based on a user's anxiety, depression, and stress levels. These levels are assessed using predefined values passed via URL parameters.

üí° Purpose
The purpose of this page is to provide users with a quick mental health overview and actionable coping strategies based on their responses in a prior assessment. It helps users better understand their current emotional state and suggests practical steps for self-care or professional support.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
The page receives three mental health scores through URL query parameters:

anxiety

depression

stress

Each score is an integer (0 to 4), corresponding to:

0: Extremely Severe

1: Severe

2: Moderate

3: Mild

4: Normal

These scores are mapped to detailed descriptive labels and each label has:

A summary explaining the user's current state.

Coping strategies tailored to that level of severity.

Using JavaScript, the scores are extracted and rendered dynamically into three sections:

Anxiety Report

Depression Report

Stress Report

Each section includes:

The severity level.

A brief explanation of what the level means.

Practical coping strategies users can apply in real life.

üß© Features

‚úÖ Clear structure for future enhancements (e.g., adding more conditions or user input validation).

‚úÖ A button to retake the assessment (links back to index.html).
